Hey guys
========

This is a pretty basic implementation of a touch listener for Android, that 
listens to touch events on your OpenGL canvas and can be queried for a
rotation which you can apply to a box. The user will be able to rotate an
object by dragging it in any direction, and it supports flinging so the
user can flick their finger to send it flying.
